# galactic-equatorial-transformations
Simple Python module that performs transformations of proper motion from equatorial to galactic (and vice versa) coordinates. It can also correct given proper motions (in Galactic or equatorial coordinates) for the Galactic differential rotation and peculiar motion of the Sun (U,V,W) that can be easily adjusted to the favorite values.
